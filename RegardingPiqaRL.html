I have personally talked to SpookRL under the false guise of &ldquo;being a fan&rdquo; to get his personal opinion on the incidents. I do not in any way condone the actions of SpookRL and find them disgusting and abhorrent, and the explicit purpose of this document is to provide a permanent and thorough account of SpookRL&rsquo;s actions and the testimonies of his victims to hold him accountable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A TL;DR is provided at the bottom.

He has a growing platform on Twitch and very small social media presence across Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, and Instagram, as well as Discord. His Discord server currently has over 600 members, many of which are aware of his past actions. Rocket League&rsquo;s &ldquo;Support-A-Creator</span><span>&rdquo; system</span><span>&nbsp;allows players to enter a verified creator&rsquo;s code, wherein any purchases they make in-game will partially go towards the creator.

I&rsquo;d recommend reading that thread as I&rsquo;m only summarizing it from an objective standpoint, and the personal perspective of the original is helpful in understanding Spook&rsquo;s impact on others. I will be going by the censorship set in that thread and censoring the names of those involved except for </span><span>Barksy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the thread&rsquo;s author), Fcisco, and Spook himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spook was involved in a friend group with Barksy, Fcisco, Queen (another victim mentioned later), and others, and initially the friendship between Spook and Fcisco was casual and normal, just friends talking to each other in DMs. However, Spook began openly talking about sexual topics while not knowing Fcisco&rsquo;s age, with Fcisco being made clearly uncomfortable. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A day after this interaction, Spook talked about a 13 year old artist within their friend group and claims it&rsquo;s difficult to stay &ldquo;PG&rdquo; around her because of her drawings. He also calls the artist a &ldquo;jailbait loli&rdquo;, jailbait being a euphemism for a minor that some people may find sexually attractive, claims that &ldquo;14 and up is legal&rdquo;, and implies that he would be open to a relationship with a person four years younger than him (he was 18 years old at the time). </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Spook and Fcisco then RP on the same day, and after finding out how old </span><span>Fcisco</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and knowing that they were a minor, Spook takes the RP into a sexual direction and describes &ldquo;spraying cum literally everywhere&rdquo; and moaning while doing so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Days later, </span><span>Fcisco</span><span>&nbsp;confronts Spook about him making them uncomfortable, and Spook asks if they are &ldquo;just trying to change the topic before I send myself to jail&rdquo;. </span><span>Fcisco</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;understands the implications behind NSFW RP while Spook is confused and trying to make a joke out of it and never addressing or agreeing to &ldquo;keep it wholesome&rdquo; (Fcisco&rsquo;s way of asking Spook to stop talking about sexual things in their DMs).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Three days after Fcisco asked him to stop, Spook asks to see Fcisco&rsquo;s cum, calling them a &ldquo;tease&rdquo; and saying he hates them teasing him. Two days after that, Spook asks for a &ldquo;cum jar&rdquo; (yes, seriously) from Fcisco, who tries to be polite about what </span><span>Spook</span><span>&nbsp;said when he then claims that since &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t in my country, so it&rsquo;s safer&rdquo; (referring to </span><span>Fcisco</span><span>&nbsp;sending it). Spook says he would &ldquo;pay money for some cum in a jar from you&rdquo;, &ldquo;even if it&rsquo;s 200 </span><span>bucks&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two days later (ten days after Spook and Fcisco first began talking in DMs), Fcisco&rsquo;s friends notice them being uncomfortable around Spook outside of their DMs, and on that same day, Spook sends another RP message describing him cumming on Fcisco&rsquo;s face and chest. When Fcisco asks him to not talk to them that way, Spook jokes about being &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; and claims that Fcisco made them &ldquo;cover my bed in cum yesterday&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Finally, 16 days after they began talking in DMs, Spook sends Fcisco a photo of his dried cum on the floor of his bedroom. Unsurprisingly, </span><span>Fcisco</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tells their friend group and they all cut contact with Spook. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To summarize, Spook&hellip;</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0 start"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Called a thirteen year old minor a &ldquo;jailbait loli&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Believes that minors fourteen years old and up are able to consent</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Starts multiple one-sided erotic roleplays with someone he knows is a minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Is fully aware that their actions are illegal (&ldquo;change the topic before I send myself to jail&rdquo;)</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Calls a minor a &ldquo;tease&rdquo; for not legally being able to consent to his sexual conversations</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Asks a minor to send a &ldquo;jar of their cum&rdquo; and offers to pay the minor to do so</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Claims he climaxed because of a minor, implying they masturbated thinking of that minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_kbm0rl67jqsc-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Provides an actual image of that climax, now dried on the floor, and sends it to the minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>By definition, and this is not for the sake of being inflammatory or accusing him of being something worse than what he is, </span><span class="c12">Spook is a pedophile</span><span>.

Pedophilia is defined as a &ldquo;psychiatric disorder in which an adult has sexual fantasies about or engages in sexual acts with a</span><span><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prepubescent&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757336063552623&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OBhNfifzd9Yl-Q2Mx3Riq">&nbsp;</a></span><span>prepubesce</span><span class="c0">nt child&rdquo;. Prepubescent does not mean only preceding puberty, as those who are going through puberty are still considered prepubescent. He openly engaged in sexual conversations with a child and sent a child a photo he took of his dried semen with the implication that the child was responsible for it. An 18 year old who fantasizes about sexual acts with a child is a pedophile. Spook is, without any misinterpretation or defense, a pedophile. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>According to Barksy&rsquo;s thread, Spook never apologized to his victims. Spook called </span><span>Barksy</span><span class="c0">, who was not even a victim of his, an &ldquo;asshole&rdquo; for unfriending him when the friend group cut contact with him. This displays a complete lack of any awareness of his actions, compounded by his comment about &ldquo;being sent to jail&rdquo;, showing that he simply doesn&rsquo;t care about what he has done to his victims. He only cares about himself and his reputation. Why should somebody who has no empathy for others feel the need to apologize for his actions? What is stopping him from doing something similar again?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what he did. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victim Two - Queen</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first portion of this section, I&rsquo;ll summarize the info present in Barksy&rsquo;s thread and then provide information given from my personal involvement with the victim described.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Queen was a part of the friend group with Barksy, Fcisco, and others when the interactions between Spook and Fcisco were taking place, and cut Spook off along with the rest after finding out what he had done with Fcisco. Barksy says themself that &ldquo;Queen has always been super friendly&rdquo;, and so months later when Queen decided to see if Spook was alright, Spook began talking to them very similarly to the way he talked to Fcisco. Spook knew that Queen was a minor as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day after reaching out to Spook, Queen says they promised a friend to RP and that it&rsquo;s getting late, wanting to go to sleep and stop their conversation. Spook expresses his sadness and calls it a &ldquo;bad compromise&rdquo; when Queen offers to &ldquo;do more rounds tomorrow&rdquo; (reffering to the online game skribbl.io, which Spook would play with Queen). It&rsquo;s subtly manipulative behavior, but he starts ramping up over time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Six days after that, Queen is hesitant to join a call with Spook and is uncomfortable using their voice to talk to him, and Spook says that he would &ldquo;mcdie if you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Queen shoots back thinking it&rsquo;s a joke, but then Spook says he has &ldquo;cut himself before&rdquo; and begs Queen to &ldquo;not make me turn into a steak&rdquo;. According to Barksy, this is on top of other instances of guilt tripping and making Queen feel like she didn&rsquo;t have his permission to talk to their friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week or so later, Queen tells him they are 13, and Spook says he &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; because &ldquo;you seem like 20 still&rdquo;. A common tactic for groomers is to tell their victim that they are mature and instill this belief in them that they know what they are doing, that the victim is mature enough to understand and make the right choices, leading to the victim doubting the fact that they were groomed. &ldquo;Most people would think you are catfishing because you just seem way older&rdquo;, Spook tells them before love bombing, an abusive tactic where abusers will shower their victims with affection after abusing them, making the victim doubt themselves and believe that the abuse wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it was. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Five days later, Spook tells Queen that they have given him an erection before saying &ldquo;don&rsquo;t hate me&rdquo;, trying to hide behind the guise of being embarrassed so Queen would feel sympathetic and not have an issue with him saying it. A week after, Spook talks about kissing Queen, &ldquo;tongue into mouth&rdquo;, &ldquo;with a lot of touching&rdquo;, implying molestation. Three days later, Spook is talking about a fantasy of his that he&rsquo;s imagining himself in with Queen. He says he&rsquo;s &ldquo;having a weird imagination&rdquo; and implies wanting him and Queen to be stuck in a closet with one another, with the likely implication by &ldquo;steamy&rdquo; meaning his fantasy was sexual in nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>According to Barksy, Spook manipulated Queen into being in a relationship with him, while he was still in a relationship with someone who was </span><span class="c12">also</span><span>&nbsp;a minor. He puts his sleep schedule into Queen&rsquo;s control and makes it her responsibility, saying he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;take good care of myself at all&rdquo;. Spook acts sad </span><span>when Queen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is rationally explaining that they can&rsquo;t be there for him at all times, sending crying emotes and telling them &ldquo;but I need you&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the end of Barksy&rsquo;s thread about Spook and their knowledge of his involvement with Queen, and I&rsquo;ll try to summarize what I&rsquo;ve learned and the screenshots I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand due to knowing King (a friend of Queen) and talking to Queen myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On the same day </span><span>that Queen</span><span>&nbsp;(censored in white) told Spook that they were 13, they talked to another friend (who I&rsquo;ll refer to as King, censored in black) about him. King is sympathetic for Queen, but wants no involvement with Spook at all. Queen refers to Spook as &ldquo;she&rdquo; due to Spook going by she/her pronouns at the time, but as of the time of writing this, Spook goes by he/him. </span><span>Queen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;claims that &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not a bad person, just troubled&rdquo;, and King reasons that &ldquo;a 19 year old shouldn&rsquo;t threaten to cut themselves if you don&rsquo;t do something with them&rdquo; (since Spook was 19 at that point).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>King continues, saying that &ldquo;people like that&rdquo; prey on people </span><span>like Queen</span><span class="c0">, who reassures King that they know, and that &ldquo;if anything happens, I&rsquo;ll get out&rdquo;. King continues that Spook &ldquo;should act more mature around you anyways, just knowing you&rsquo;re a minor&rdquo;, to which Queen again tells them not to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Queen shares the screenshot that was in Barksy&rsquo;s thread about Spook&rsquo;s reaction to them being 13, and King asks what Spook saying &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; means, to which Queen doesn&rsquo;t know either. King again says that if Spook continues to behave this way despite Queen telling him not to, Queen needs to stop talking to him. Queen says that Spook &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t broken the last chance yet&rdquo;, but that they will remind him anyway since Spook and his girlfriend &ldquo;have been in a rough spot lately&rdquo;. </span><span>Queen</span><span>&nbsp;shows a self-awareness of Spook&rsquo;s language towards them and says that they &ldquo;hope they aren&rsquo;t making his gf jealous&rdquo;, to which King tells them that that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible </span><span>given Queen&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;age.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are multiple instances of &ldquo;movie nights</span><span>&rdquo; that</span><span>&nbsp;Spook would want to have with Queen. Spook and Queen would join a room on Kosmi.io, a website for hosting online watch parties of films similar to websites like Rabb.it or </span><span>Synctube</span><span>. Messages sent on Kosmi are deleted after a certain amount of time, and unfortunately there are no screenshots of the text conversations between Queen and Spook. </span><span>Queen</span><span>&nbsp;would bring movie nights up </span><span>with King</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a reason why they wouldn&rsquo;t be available, but ultimately Queen never joined a call with Spook despite him pressuring them. There is an implication to how he might have had negative reactions due to them being unwilling to call him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Further on, Queen talks about feeling like Spook finds his streams more important than them, and there are multiple instances of them describing Spook as &ldquo;obsessive&rdquo;, yet Queen still seemingly has some level of dependency on him. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spook&rsquo;s behavior with Queen can be described as grooming, where an abuser will target a victim and manipulate them into developing a sense of dependency on the abuser, make the victim fearful of not doing what the abuser asks of them, and alienation from the victim&rsquo;s other social relationships. From the screenshots provided, Queen seems to depend on Spook and feels a sense of pity for him after their friend group alienated him months prior. They&rsquo;re afraid of how Spook would react due to their unwillingness to join calls with him. The fact that Spook wanted to have movie nights every night and would react poorly due to Queen being unwilling seems like it was his attempt at finding a stepping stone to further attempts at alienation and overall grooming of Queen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To summarize, Spook&hellip; </span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0 start"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Began talking to a former friend again after they reached out to him</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Attempted to groom that former friend, who he knew was 13 years old</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Threatened self harm whenever the minor he was grooming was unable to talk to him</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Love bombed and told the minor he was grooming that they &ldquo;seem older than 13&rdquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Implied a desire to kiss and molest a minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Interacted with a minor in a romantic and sexual context while in a relationship</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Manipulated a minor to the point of them being unable to take their friend&rsquo;s advice to cut him off</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Was described by a minor as &ldquo;obsessive&rdquo; and was overly dependent on the relationship he had with a minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_qwjj7b6yue1t-0"><li class="c1 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Groomed a minor</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>So, not only is SpookRL a pedophile who explicitly roleplayed with a minor and sent them an explicit photo of his dried semen (implying masturbating thinking of that minor), but he is </span><span class="c12">also</span><span>&nbsp;a groomer who abused a 13 year old child. Not only was he grooming this 13 year old while in a relationship with his girlfriend (who was </span><span class="c12">also</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a minor), but he also abused them after facing the consequences of the minor he had sexually interacted with months prior (wherein his friend group where he found both minors decided to cut him off). Thankfully, Queen has been able to come to terms with what Spook was doing to them, but they have been suffering from the trauma it caused them. Spook traumatized a 13 year old child by grooming them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Spook&rsquo;s Response</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite his actions, Spook has addressed what he&rsquo;s done on multiple occasions while tip-toeing around the reality of it and trying to make what he did seem less disturbing than the truth. A statement he made in a Discord server where he pinged every member (likely his own server) is written in a way that makes him out to be a troubled mind who made a small mistake. It doesn&rsquo;t go into any details whatsoever, and there is no apology to be found for either of his victims. It was likely written in response to Barsky&rsquo;s thread about him, given the date of the message being a day after the thread was posted, and seems to have the sole intent of trying to absolve himself of any criticism by having a written account he can point to and say &ldquo;see? I made a statement about this already, stop talking about it&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He claims to have made an active effort to improve himself, despite grooming Queen less than a month prior, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to not allow him the opportunity to improve. His actions are illegal and reprehensible, but I cannot personally speak to the idea of him lying about trying to improve. It is a bit of a strange statement to bring up his pansexuality in given that it has zero relevance to the atrocities he&rsquo;s committed, and while it reeks of the non-apologetic deflecting that is almost laughably common in most statements abusers make when faced with the consequences of their actions, one must be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. I personally loathe the very idea of that mindset given my own personal experience with abuse, but for the sake of transparency and objective opinion, the official stance of this document is following the assumption that what he said is true, and that he is trying to improve himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Of course, regardless of objectivity, I can back up my opinion of Spook with the interactions I had with him. These next few paragraphs will be my own perspective about him and should be taken in a different light compared to the previous sections of this document. This is no </span><span>longer an objective</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;summary and rather my own personal opinion of Spook.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On December 17th 2020, back when I was planning on first writing this document (before procrastinating for two months but anyway), I joined SpookRL&rsquo;s discord server and sent him a direct message under the guise of being a fan of his content, despite never knowing about him prior to learning about what he did with Fcisco and Queen. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For full transparency: I do not support Spook in any possible way. I do not condone any of his actions and wrote this document out of an obligation to immortalize what I know about him. As a victim of abuse, I was never able to speak out about my abuser, and to this day, they have not faced any consequences for what they&rsquo;ve done to me. I don&rsquo;t want the same to happen to </span><span>Fcisco</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Queen. Spook&rsquo;s actions can not be swept under the rug like he would want them to be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of what I said in my interactions with Spook were lies to get him to trust me, because I do not see any wrongdoing in giving him a small taste of his own medicine. I&rsquo;m not a fan of Spook. I do not see both sides. The amount of time that has passed since his actions does not matter. I do not feel sorry for him. I was disgusted while talking to him due to how unapologetic he seemed, and how I felt like I was putting myself at risk by acting as a fan to make him let his guard down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The following screenshots have been censored to protect my identity, and a small section of some messages I sent were censored to remove information that may have been used to identify me. I put full faith in the reader to be able to decide for themselves if he has truly changed or not, and I trust the reader to believe me when I say that I would personally prefer if Spook never interacted with another human soul again. He does not deserve the platform he has after what he has done to multiple children.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 397.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 397.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 377.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 377.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 428.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 428.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 242.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 242.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 380.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 380.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 380.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 380.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 242.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 242.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 376.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After &ldquo;thanking&rdquo; him for replying, I was not planning to continue speaking to him, but I admit that I got caught up in the moment while relaying the screenshots to a friend and made small talk in hopes of him revealing more information.
